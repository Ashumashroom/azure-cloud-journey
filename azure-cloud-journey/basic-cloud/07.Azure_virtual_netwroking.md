🧱 1. Azure Virtual Network (VNet) – Foundation
What is a VNet?

Subnets, address spaces (CIDR), and peering

Route tables and network traffic flow

🔐 2. Network Security – Firewalls and NSGs
Network Security Groups (NSGs)

Restricting traffic by IP, port, protocol

Associating NSGs with subnets vs NICs

Azure Firewall

Stateful firewall overview

Application and network rule collections

DNAT/SNAT rules

Bypass Techniques (for learning)

Trusted services

Service endpoints vs Private Endpoints

UDR misconfigurations to avoid

🧳 3. Azure Bastion – Secure VM Access
What is Azure Bastion?

Creating Bastion inside a subnet AzureBastionSubnet

How to:

Connect to a VM through browser (SSH/RDP)

Access NGINX hosted on a private VM

🔐 Limit Bastion access to specific users (RBAC)

Azure role: Virtual Machine Login

Conditional Access with Bastion

🚪 4. NGINX Behind Azure Bastion
Hosting NGINX on a private VM (no public IP)

Accessing NGINX:

SSH via Bastion

Test using curl or browser over SSH tunnel

Reverse proxy setup (if app servers behind NGINX)

Configure firewall to only allow NGINX HTTP/HTTPS ports

🧭 5. Access Control – Only Limited User Access
Use RBAC for limiting access to:

VNets

Bastion host

Specific VMs

Combine with NSG rules to limit IP range

Use Azure AD login for VMs if needed
