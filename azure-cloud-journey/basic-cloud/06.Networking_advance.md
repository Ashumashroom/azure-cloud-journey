## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Azure Application Gateway & WAF

### üîπ Azure Application Gateway
- Layer 7 load balancer (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Routes traffic based on URL path, host headers, etc.
- Supports SSL termination, cookie-based session affinity, and custom probes
- Scales automatically and integrates with Azure Monitor

### üîπ Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Built-in with Application Gateway (WAF SKU)
- Protects against common web attacks like SQL Injection, XSS
- Uses OWASP core rule sets
- Supports custom rules, logging, and monitoring

‚úÖ **Use Case**: Protect public-facing web apps with intelligent HTTP routing + security.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Azure Load Balancer

### üîπ Key Features:
- Layer 4 load balancer (TCP/UDP)
- Routes traffic based on source/destination IP & port
- Comes in Basic and Standard SKUs
- Supports Health Probes, Inbound NAT Rules, and HA Ports

### üî∏ Types:
- **Public Load Balancer**: Distributes external traffic to VMs
- **Internal Load Balancer**: Used within VNets for internal service-to-service balancing

‚úÖ **Use Case**: High-performance, low-level traffic distribution for backend VMs.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Azure DNS

- Hosts DNS domains and provides name resolution using Microsoft Azure infrastructure
- Ultra-low latency and 99.99% SLA
- Supports A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, NS, SRV, PTR records
- Supports private DNS zones for name resolution within VNets

‚úÖ **Use Case**: Replace third-party DNS hosting for public and private DNS zones.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Azure Firewall

- Managed, cloud-native network security firewall
- Stateful inspection of inbound, outbound, and lateral traffic
- Supports Application (FQDN) and Network Rules, Threat Intelligence, and Logging
- Integrated with Azure Monitor and Microsoft Defender

‚úÖ **Use Case**: Protect VNets from malicious traffic, enforce central policies.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Virtual Network Peering

- Connects two VNets for seamless traffic flow
- Low-latency, high-throughput Microsoft backbone routing
- Peered VNets appear as one for communication
- Can be intra-region or global

‚úÖ **Use Case**: Connect VNets across different regions or departments securely and efficiently.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ VNet Gateway

- Used for connecting Azure VNets to on-premises networks or other VNets
- Supports:
  - VPN Gateway: For site-to-site, point-to-site (P2S), and VNet-to-VNet IPsec/IKE VPN tunnels
  - ExpressRoute Gateway: For connecting via private, dedicated links
- Requires a gateway subnet within the VNet

‚úÖ **Use Case**: Hybrid cloud setup, private network extension into Azure.
